# weather-monitor

## Description



The motivation for this weather application is to bring the user the ability to check the weather in multiple cities for a five day forecast. This allows the user to be prepared for inclimate weather in their area or warm family of upcoming issues. I learned that I need to study how arrays work and collect more tools to use when writing code. Implementation of the tools learned in class play a major role in this assignment.



## Usage

The user will enter a city and press the search button. The current day will populate with information of the temmerature, wind etc. There will also be 5 cards that populate suppling the user with information for the next 5 days within the city they selected. Once a city is clicked it will be stored in the local storage so if they wish to select that city again the cards will quickly repopulate.
